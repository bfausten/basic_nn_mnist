# basic_nn_mnist
a very basic neural network.

i'm using this for training git, conda environments and neural networks.

## network architecture
the network consists of two layers (ReLU(784, 128) and softmax(128,10)).
i'm using MSE loss function and simple gradient descent with backpropagation.

## results
